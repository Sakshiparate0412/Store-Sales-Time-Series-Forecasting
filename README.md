# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting future store sales using historical time-series data to support data-driven business decision-making. Accurate sales forecasting is critical for inventory planning, demand management, and revenue optimization, and this project aims to build a reliable predictive pipeline using machine learning techniques.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing and cleaning, where missing values, inconsistencies, and date-based features are handled to ensure data quality. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover sales trends, seasonality patterns, and correlations between variables. Visualizations are used to better understand temporal behavior and sales fluctuations over time.

Next, feature engineering is applied to extract meaningful time-based features such as day, month, year, and lag values, which help the model capture seasonal and cyclical trends. Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the most effective approach for forecasting sales. Model performance is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy and generalization.

The project emphasizes not only model performance but also interpretability and real-world applicability. The results demonstrate how historical data can be transformed into actionable insights that help businesses anticipate demand and make informed operational decisions.

This repository provides a complete end-to-end time-series forecasting pipeline, making it suitable for learning, experimentation, and practical implementation. It reflects real-world challenges such as noisy data, seasonality, and trend shifts, and highlights the importance of preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation in building robust forecasting models.
